{branches_section}

Please provide a concise summary up {bullet_count} bullet points highlighting the major changes and updates of this branch vs original repository.
Focus on the most important features, bug fixes, and improvements, what adds value to user.
Don't repeat yourself, summarize, if you don't have anything new to add, don't add.
Up to 15 words per bullet.
Sort the bullets, so first will be the major changes and news.
Don't include version numbers (unless it major version update).
If there are no changes in readme, don't mention it, mention only what new features.
Don't speak about how many commits ahead, user already saw it.
Don't make up things, use the Branch Analysis  (Parent repository README is for context, not for news).

Focus on practical value and multi-branch development patterns. Output plain text without markdown formatting for terminal display.

(For context only about the original repository, not news) Parent repository README:
