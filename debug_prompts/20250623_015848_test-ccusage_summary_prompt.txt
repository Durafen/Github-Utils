- fix: add offline flag support to blocks command (by zhiyue on 2025-06-20T12:55:13Z)
  Full message: The --offline flag was not being passed to loadSessionBlockData() in the blocks command,
  and loadSessionBlockData() was not passing it to PricingFetcher constructor.
  
  This fix ensures the blocks command respects the --offline flag like other commands do.
  
  Fixes #127
